# R-Project-Visualizing-COVID-19

In this project, I visualized data from the early months of the coronavirus outbreak to uncover insights about how this virus grew to be a global pandemic. 

This project allowed me to apply skills from several DataCamp courses, including importing different file types, manipulating data frames using dplyr, and making plots using ggplot2.
